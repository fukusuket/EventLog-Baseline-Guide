The technique involves manipulating strings to hide functionality, such as constructing class names using string insertion (e.g., 'indowsInstaller.Installer'.Insert(0,'W')) and correcting
malformed URLs (e.g., converting 'htps://' to 'https://') at runtime. This behavior is commonly associated with malware loaders or droppers that aim to bypass static detection
by hiding intent in runtime-generated strings and using legitimate tools for code execution. The use of `InstallProduct` and COM object creation, particularly combined with
hidden window execution and suppressed UI, indicates an attempt to install software (likely malicious) without user interaction.

"Remote Access Tool - Action1 Arbitrary Code Execution and Remote Sessions","medium","","process_creation","Detects the execution of Action1 in order to execute arbitrary code or establish a remote session.

Action1 is a powerful Remote Monitoring and Management tool that enables users to execute commands, scripts, and binaries.
Through the web interface of action1, the administrator must create a new policy or an app to establish remote execution and then points that the agent is installed.

Hunting Opportunity 1- Weed Out The Noise

When threat actors execute a script, a command, or a binary through these new policies and apps, the names of these become visible in the command line during the execution process. Below is an example of the command line that contains the deployment of a binary through  a policy with name ""test_app_1"":

ParentCommandLine: ""C:\WINDOWS\Action1\action1_agent.exe schedule:Deploy_App__test_app_1_1681327673425 runaction:0""

After establishing a baseline, we can split the command to extract the policy name and group all the policy names and inspect the results with a list of frequency occurrences.

Hunting Opportunity 2 - Remote Sessions On Out Of Office Hours

If you have admins within your environment using remote sessions to administer endpoints, you can create a threat-hunting query and modify the time of the initiated sessions looking for abnormal activity.
